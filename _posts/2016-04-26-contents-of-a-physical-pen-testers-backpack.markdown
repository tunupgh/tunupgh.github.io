Some companies pay for a security assessment to see if their physical building and office are secure. When they secure a building they want to test it to make sure it's off limits to people who shouldn't be able to get there, such as a datacenter. Sometimes these assessments are to test employees to see if they would let people in areas that they shouldn't have access to, such as a random person walking behind a bank teller.

What do these type of pen testers bring to this type of security assessment? Here's a few different people talking about what they bring.

## Vest of Doom
[Jayson Street](https://twitter.com/jaysonstreet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) has talked about his Vest of Doom a few times.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About to load my new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VestofD00M?src=hash">#VestofD00M</a> v.7.0 :-) for my engagement in France after I speak at <a href="https://twitter.com/hackinparis">@hackinparis</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/NuitDuHack">@NuitDuHack</a> <a href="http://t.co/aSGUoOnWZ2">pic.twitter.com/aSGUoOnWZ2</a></p>&mdash; Jayson E.

He talks about the contents in his [DefCon 18 talk](https://youtu.be/EzGwO5L9oq4?t=38m3s) and again in his [DefCon 19 talk](https://youtu.be/4-qnYaw7VGo?t=30m20s). Both talks are great to watch in their entirety to get a sense of how Jayson gains access to anything.

## Pen Test Backpack

[c0ncealed](https://twitter.com/c0ncealed) gives a great breakdown of all his pack's contents in his [Physical Pen Test Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRx1NmG7h2I). He goes into what each of these items are used for. A great watch!

His demonstration shows how easy it is to swing the pack to the front, pull out a laptop, put the laptop on the pack, and begin doing work. The sling pack being used as a mobile table is really handy because it allows your hands to be free to do other things.
