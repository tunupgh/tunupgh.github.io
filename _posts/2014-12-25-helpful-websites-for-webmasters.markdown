As a webmaster I find myself bookmarking a lot of sites that help me. Here's a list of the most helpful ones. Each of the websites listed are free or offer a free service.

## Domain Name Finders
Need to find a good name for your next website project? These sites will offer a lot of great options.

## SEO Tools

Some tools to help with SEO.

#### http://alexa.com
Alexa is a great way to track the popularity of a website. It has other interesting information too.

#### http://rankpay.com
I've tried their service before and they charge a lot more than you expect. However, they do offer a free lookup to see how many monthly searches a keyword has. This is useful for finding the right name for an article or website name.

####  http://woorank.com
This page will analyze your website and give recommendations based on what it found to improve SEO.

#### http://www.semrush.com/info/history/index.html
A cool tool to track and compare the popularity of competing websites.

#### http://siteliner.com
This tool will analyze all of the content of your website to see if you have duplicate content.

#### http://www.google.com/adwords
By going to tools > keyword planner you can do research on which keyword terms are higher traffic than others. This is helpful for deciding what the title of a page should be or the content of your site. This keyword planner is a free tool and does not require the purchase of any adwords.

## Analytics Tools
Gain insight to the users that are visiting your page.

#### http://www.google.com/analytics
Google Analytics is a super easy and beautiful analytics tool. I'm not a fan of Google and wish I could find another free alternative to website analytics but their tool is the best I've used.


#### https://www.google.com/webmasters
Google Webmaster tools will show you a view into what search terms people are using on Google to access your website.

#### http://piwik.org
If you want to bring your analytics internally piwik is probably the best choice to use.


## Free Images

#### http://www.flaticon.com
This site has a huge database of free vector graphics and icons. 

#### http://fontawesome.io
Fontawesome combines with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) in a way that extends the basic Bootstrap icons into many more.

#### https://www.iconfinder.com
This site has both free and paid vector images and icons. 

#### http://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/freebies
Smashing Magazine often releases freebie icon packs. This is a large trove of vector graphics and icons that are free.

Some additional resources from the team at stinkyink.

#### https://unsplash.com/collections
Free high quality photos.

## Command Reference 

#### http://devdocs.io
Previously called dochub.io and before that instacss. Devdocs is a easy to use cheat sheet for looking up html, css, javascript, and many other web programming language commands.

#### http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_quickref.asp
W3Schools is a great place to look up commands for web programming languages. The link will take you directly to the SQL quick reference guide which is what I use the site mostly for.

## Design

#### https://pixlr.com/
This site is like a simplified version of photoshop except it's free and online.

#### https://www.draw.io/
Here's an easy to use free online tool that lets you make network diagrams, flow charts, graphs, and drawings. I use it as a cheap and fast Visio alternative but keep in mind it can't import Visio diagrams or shapes.

#### https://www.canva.com
A site that just focuses on making images with captions. I use it frequently to make content for social media sites. It's like a motivational poster and quote 


## Misc Tools

#### http://trello.com
A fantastic note keeping tool. I use it to track bugs, write ideas down, and create to do lists for websites I'm working on. It works great with multiple users at once and has a nice API that you can use to bring specific lists onto your own website.
