   <p>The goal of this tool will be to examine the config of a Cisco ASA and suggest a config that can be used to clean up the config. It will do the following actions after looking at the “show running-config”:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Determine if there are any unused ACL’s. Any that aren’t being used will be subject for removal.</li>
    <li>Determine if there are any unused objects and object-groups. Any that aren’t being used will be subject for removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special Notes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>This script is 100% client side. Meaning nothing you enter will be uploaded to this website.</li>
    <li>This is an experimental tool. Backup your config before making any changes suggested by this tool.</li>
</ul>
        <br /><br />
    <p>Paste the output of "show run" in the box below.</p>

        <form name="convert" method="get">

        <textarea rows="10" name="showrun" class="input-block-level">
        </textarea>
