When conducting a failover of a Cisco NAC cluster, first determine the status of the node youâ€™re currently on:

```
. /perfigo/common/bin/fostate.sh
My node is active, peer node is standby
```

Next, conduct the failover by doing one of the following commands:
 
`shutdown`<br>
`reboot`<br>
`service perfigo stop`<br>
