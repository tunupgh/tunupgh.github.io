Is it possible for a website to have good customer service? How can that be defined? I recently attended a lecture that attempted to define what good customer service is. It wasn't intended for the web but more of a face to face experience like in a restaurant. Upon listening to the lecture I started connecting it to how it relates to the web. 

The lecture explained that there are 5 dimensions to customer service. I will go over each of them and what that means for for a face to face interaction like in a restaurant and what I think it means on a webpage.

Imagine if you go to a restaurant, how many of these 5 things can be bad before you have a bad experience? Just one. I think the same is true for the online experience. Just one of these things can be bad and the whole user experience becomes bad.

## Reliability
The ability to provide what was promised dependably and accurately.

#### In A Restaurant
- If you order a salad without cheese that better be what you received.
- If the menu says there are vegan options, the server better know what the word vegan means.
- If the hours are specified on the door the place better be open during those times or having a sign explaining a special circumstance.

#### Online
- The website should be up and available 24/7/365.
- The website should respond to any combination of www, non-www, http, https. It can redirect the user to the correct one but should respond to all of them.
- Things that look like links or buttons on the webpage should actually be links and buttons that work and do something.


## Assurance
The knowledge and courtesy of employees, and their ability to convey trust and confidence.

#### In A Restaurant
- If you ask about what ingredients are in a meal the server shouldn't just shrug and say they don't know.
- The staff should be courteous and kind to the customers.

#### Online
- The site better be secure and any information I give should not be given to people I don't want to give it to.
- Are there typos on the site? 
- Does the copy (words on the page) look great? Things should be explained simply and quickly but accurately. 


## Empathy
The degree of caring and individual attention provided to customers.

#### In A Restaurant
- The server should check on you frequently to make sure there isn't anything you need.
- The chef should care about the quality of ingredients and how the meal tastes.
- The chef should take time to make the presentation of the dish great. I don't want to eat out of a horse trough. I like my food to be presented in a way that looks delicious. 

#### Online
- Is the website user friendly and give the user a simple path to the goal they have?
- Can I figure out what the website does quickly and know what it can do to help me?
- Does the website have a simple and intuitive user interface or require extensive help or a manual to figure out how to use it?

In my opinion, a website that has poor usability is equivalent to having a server that was rude to you in a restaurant. The website didn't try to put your needs first which is ease of use and getting your tasks done quickly.


## Responsiveness
The willingness to help customers and provide prompt service.

#### In A Restaurant
- If you ask for a refill on your drink it should arrive quickly and not 30 minutes later or worse, never.

#### Online
- Does the site allow a user to navigate it easily? 
- If I get lost on the site is it easy to go back to a familiar page?
- Does the website offer help on hard to understand sections?
- Is there confusing terminology that only an expert would understand?



## Tangibles
The physical facilities and equipment, and the appearance of personnel.

#### In A Restaurant

- Was the bathroom clean?
- Was your fork clean?
- Did the staff appear to have good hygiene?

#### Online

- Does the color scheme look good?
- Are the fonts readable?
- Does the overall style and appearance of the site look good?
- Do the pictures match the content or help me in any way?
