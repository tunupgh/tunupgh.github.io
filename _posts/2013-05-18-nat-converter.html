Do you need to convert ASA 8.2 and under code to the new ASA 8.3+ code? The NAT statements are entirely different in the new code. During the upgrade the ASA will try to convert it automatically but this is worthless because it does a horrible job at it. Cisco recommends using auto NAT. This is also bad advice to use Auto NAT because it makes extremly ugly and hard to manage code. This conversion tool will convert your NAT statements to the easist to read and manage code.<br>
<br>
<h3>Preparing your code</h3>
Gather the output from the following commands in your old ASA code:<br>
<code><pre>show run global<br>
show run nat<br>
show run static</pre></code>

If there are any related ACLs in the NAT statements get that configuration also by doing:<br>
<code><pre>show run access-list | include [ACL-NAME]</pre></code>
Paste the output from the commands above into the text area and click convert. You should examine the results to verify the config is accurate.<br><br>
<strong>Privacy Note:</strong> None of the data entered into the text area is uploaded to a server. All of the work of this tool is done on the client side. This means it's safe to enter sensitive data without worrying about it traveling over the internet. You can even connect to this webpage, disconnect from internet and still use the conversion tool without any difference in functionality.
