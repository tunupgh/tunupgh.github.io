Sometimes when you are using a laptop with multiple displays and then unplug from those displays there will be windows that are outside the viewing area of your laptop. Sometimes these windows can be pesky and not want to come back to the screen. If you are using Windows 7, try this:

1. Select the program from the task bar
2. Alt + Space + M
3. Tap arrow key
4. Reposition window with mouse
