I am a bit of a geek when it comes to workflow and that means I have tried out many text editors. Notepad, Notepad++, TextMate, Crimson Editor and VIM were all favorites of mine at one point. Now there is one that truly stands out as being superior for me. That is Sublime Text 2. I won't go into how awesome this text editor is in this post, I will leave that for you to find out on your own. This text editor is geared towards programmers though. No matter how much I searched I could not find anyone who has integrated it with Cisco. Here are some links to my github account which includes Cisco Syntax Definitions and Cisco Snippets for Sublime Text 2.

## Cisco Syntax Definitions for Sublime Text 2/3
What does this mean? Take a look at this screenshot from a recent script I was working on in Sublime Text 2:

The Cisco Syntax definitions looks for specific keywords in a .txt or .cfg file and highlights them. In the example above I am using the Eifel color scheme which goes well with it.

## Cisco Snippets for Sublime Text 2
Snippets are a super cool productivity enhancer for me when working with Cisco devices. With snippets I can type a short word like 'static' and it expands into a multi line script which is essentially a framework for a static NAT config. Take a look at this example.
