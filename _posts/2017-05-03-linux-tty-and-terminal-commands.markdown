A few notes for using the Linux TTY terminal.

## Switch Terminals

You can switch TTY terminals by doing:

`CNTRL`+`ALT`+`F#`

F2 will take you to TTY2, F3 TTY3 etc. 

If you are using a Linux GUI, you can still use this combo to switch to the console. To get back to the GUI do `CNTRL`+`ALT`+`F7`.



## Scrolling

If you need to scroll up or town while at the console, do:

`SHIFT`+`PG UP/DOWN`
